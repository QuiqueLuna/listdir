# listdir
The program takes a path as input and generates a JSON file in the following way: if the current file is a folder the recursion generates that JSON first and append it to the main one, otherwise the file name and file size are appended as to the JSON. This program uses the library jsoncpp in order to create the JSON, and filesystem in order to move between paths and analizing the file type.
